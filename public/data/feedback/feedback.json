I put in effort to tackle it, and I think it's okay now, but in comparison to the other subjects, I felt that there was more care about the other subjects."

We were shouting out our thoughts like yeah I saw these spikes in biology they are blah blah blah and yeah I also saw this in control theory this means... and yeah yeah this RC circuit it's a low pass filter that's why the graph looks like this.. It made the whole experience so awesome for real."

      "feedback": "I liked the diversity of both participants and instructors and the multidisciplinary nature of topics and discussions. The course was satisfactory as an introduction to the field, and its environment was very friendly and indiscriminative, which is highly appreciated! What I found quite hard to cope with is the very long hours, especially with materials relatively foreign to individuals with a long biology background, and being in a subgroup with participants all from an engineering/CS backgrounds was also kind of challenging."

      "feedback": "- الكورس اهتم بالفكرة العامة من خلال محاضرات الدكاترة ومحاولة إسقاط ماندرسه على الواقع ومشاركة التجارب والمناقشات بين الطلاب والدكاترة وعدم الانغماس الكبير في التفاصيل والتوازن ده مهم جدا بالنسبة لي."

      "feedback": "Honestly, there is great effort in this course. It is very strong and beneficial. The workload is somehow high, especially if there are undergraduates like me. Due to my final exam schedule, I couldn't attend Biostatistics day. But generally, the course is very professional."
